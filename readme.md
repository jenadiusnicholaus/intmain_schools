# Intmain online school Project

## Collabration Guide for a team

- We have two Branches on this project , `main` and `develop`

   Roles for Branches:
    - main : set for Final and ready  to  be deployed features
    - develop : set for on development features or fixes

## Instructions we will be following to collabrate effectivelly

- Create a new branch for every seprate feature or fixes from  `develop` and ones the feature is done then create a Pull request a.k.a (PR) comparing to `develop` then after the approval you will be allowed to merge your `feat-branch `to `develop` and then `dev ops` will take a role to merge `develop` to `main` then `main` to production .



## Pros of doing this
 - To avoid unnecesssary merging conflicts
 - Merging our commits for every separate features or fixes

 ## install and start collaborating now

    git clone git@github.com:jenadiusnicholaus/intmain_schools.git
